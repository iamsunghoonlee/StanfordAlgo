### 1. In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the 2SAT problem. Here are 6 different 2SAT instances:

**4-4 2SAT1.txt**

**4-4 2SAT2.txt**

**4-4 2SAT3.txt**

**4-4 2SAT4.txt**

**4-4 2SAT5.txt**

**4-4 2SAT6.txt**

The file format is as follows. In each instance, the number of variables and the number of clauses is the same, and this number is specified on the first line of the file. Each subsequent line specifies a clause via its two literals, with a number denoting the variable and a"-" sign denoting logical "not". For example, the second line of the first data file is "-16808 75250", which indicates the clause 7 X16808 V X75250.

Your task is to determine which of t he 6 instances are satisfiable, and which are unsatisfiable. In the box below, enter a 6-bit string, where t he ith bit should be 1 if the ith instance is satisfiable, and 0 otherwise. For example, if you think that the first 3 instances are satisfiable and the last 3 are not, then you should enter the string 111000 in the box below.
